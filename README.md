# Language-Centric AI & Policy Text Analytics  
Ioannis Papagiannopoulos  

This repository presents selected work at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, large-scale policy text analytics, and socio-economic modelling, developed during my MSc in Data Science & Machine Learning.

My focus lies in structured analysis of complex textual corpora, multilingual document processing, and transformer-based semantic modelling — with particular interest in Greek-language and EU policy texts.

## Research Orientation

Particular interest in large language models (LLMs), semantic representation learning, and cross-lingual transfer — especially in structurally rich languages such as Greek.  
Focused on reproducible experimentation, interpretability, and scalable text-processing pipelines.

## 1. Policy Document NLP Pipeline (Multilingual / EU Context)

Designed and implemented a modular NLP pipeline for the structured analysis of national and municipal policy documents across multiple European countries.

Core components:

- Multilingual text preprocessing (including Greek-language corpora)
- Metadata profiling and schema harmonisation
- Transformer-based semantic embeddings (Sentence-BERT / MiniLM variants)
- Document similarity detection and redundancy mapping
- Structured export for downstream quantitative evaluation
- Reproducible workflow design (controlled random states, staged outputs)

The system transforms unstructured legal and policy texts into machine-interpretable representations suitable for clustering, semantic retrieval, and comparative policy assessment.

## 2. Large-Scale Text Clustering & Topic Modelling

Applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify latent thematic structures across ~150+ long-form policy documents.

Methods included:

- TF-IDF and transformer-based embeddings
- K-Means clustering with stability checks
- Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for topic extraction
- Semantic similarity matrices and interpretability validation
- Manual audit layer (human-in-the-loop validation)

The objective was to uncover structural patterns, thematic overlaps, and policy gaps in complex institutional corpora.

## 3. Energy Poverty & Social Policy Analytics

Built a structured analytical framework to evaluate energy poverty policies, focusing on vulnerable populations and disability inclusion within EU national systems.

Work involved:

- Cross-country policy mapping
- Extraction of eligibility logic and financial support mechanisms
- Detection of implementation asymmetries
- Comparative assessment of national frameworks
- Integration of socio-economic indicators embedded in textual regulations

This research bridges computational linguistics and socio-economic policy modelling.
